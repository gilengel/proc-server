This repo contains the service to manage the single pages a user can create, manipulate or delete.

The frontend is written in Typescript using Vue3 and Quasar.
The backend is written in pure Rust (with a little shell executing script)

All code is created test driven.

## Release Cycles
There is no fix release cycle. This project was started to learn about cloud architecture and test the current stage and limits of using
rust in a cloud environment - stable and continous releases are only a secondary concern. If you like you can change this situation by
either participating as programmer/designer/...  

## Contributing?

Please keep the following points in mind:

* This is an open source project
* Everybody is welcome, expert, novice and everyone between
